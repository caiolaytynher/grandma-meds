# Grandma Meds

A CLI app that helps me to know when I'll have to buy more meds based
of the amount of dosage per day and how much of the med is left.

If you are planning on using the app, please specify the path to the
data inside of the variable ```DATA```. In my case it's an absolute
path because I want to be able to run this script from anywhere in
my terminal. So, I just made an alias that runs this script anytime
and anywhere I want.
